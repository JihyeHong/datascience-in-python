## Google Trends about Cryptocurrencies
This is a small experiment to show if Google Trends data has a predictive power in Cryptocurrency markets. <p> 
 
* What is Google Trends data? <p>
Google Trends data is a good indicator to see the popularity of a search term.
As an index, it demonstrates how much interest Google users feel in a given search term for a given time and region.
It shows the search interest as numbers between 0 to 100, a value of 100 means the peak interest of the term during the period. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. 0 means that there was not enough data for the term. <p>

* Relation between Google Trends in Cryptocurrencies and Market Prediction <p>
Hypothesis: Google Trends data has a predictability in Crypto Markets. <p>
e.g > Bigger interests in a certain currency means that the coin market will be bullish. 
 
* Experiments <p>
 Picked a random set of cryptocurrencies and visualised the historical market price and search interests in Google on the currency to see if they have similar patterns over time. 
 
* Result <p>
With only this naive approach, it seems there are some connection between growing Google interests and price increases relatively in certain coins, especially rather small currencies such as XMR and ZEC as compared to BTC and ETH. <p>
Based on this experiment, interest in major coins can be rather noisy but search popularity in small currencies are seemingly relevant to the change of market price.
